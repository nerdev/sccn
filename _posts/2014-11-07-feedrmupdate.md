title: Removed Feeds
---

I just removed the North Mankato Student Life feed from the application, as well as the Faribault events feed. I removed the North Mankato Student Life feed because I realized that the North Mankato Events calendar already has the Student Life events incoperated into it, and there is no need to have both. I removed the Faribault Events calendar, because it never had any posts. I did leave the Faribault Events calendar in the application, because it was active. 

P.S. I also added in a feed for Star Alert. Sorry it took me so long to incorperate this, but I kind of lost track of it.
