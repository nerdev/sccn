I just wanted to let you all know that the current build that I have
hosted on github is working. If anyone would like to test it, feel free, but
please give me feedback.

There are a few bugs that I have yet to work out:

1. Curcumflex A showing up in the atom feeds.
2. Dates not being formatted correctly on certain entries (RSS/Atom).

If you would like to take care of any bugs you find or fix the current bugs
that I am aware of, I welcome you to do so.

Thanks,

Tyler
