title: New scripts.
---

I have created some new php scripts that will convert the Google calendar feeds into RSS feeds so that they will display without any issues in the app. It does look like this also speeds up the process of displaying them, because more of the processing is done in the cloud instead of on your phone. I used Open Shift, a Red Hat company, to host these scripts. I highly recommend them. I was going to use Google App Engine, but it was more trouble than it was worth. I am working on a maven port of the app as we speak. I don't know if this will benefit the app at all, but I would like to give it a try and test it out. As always, if anyone would like to help test the app for me, I can make an apk for you to load on your phone and tell me what you think. I would like to test on all devices, and I can using an emulator, but it's not the same as using bare metal. If I see that the need is great, I will start compiling apks with each new release.

Thanks,

Tyler
