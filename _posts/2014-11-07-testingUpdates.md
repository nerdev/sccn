I just wanted to update everyone following the project, to let you know that I
have been performing a lot of device testing on various different phones,
tablets and android versions. So far from my testing I have concluded that SCC
Notifications should run on just about any device and android version. So far
every device and version I've tested it on has performed flawlessly.
