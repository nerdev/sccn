title: Welcome to the Official SCC Notifications Website!
---

This is just the first post of many. I just wanted to thank all the future users of my app.
When I started my capstone project, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. But then it hit me,
why don't I do create something that will give back to the great community here at SCC.
That's when I decided to make this app to help the students and/or faculty/staff stay connected
to their favorite college. I wouldn't be where I am today without everyone at SCC and this is
my way of thanking you for getting me through the tough times. I hope you all enjoy
SCC Notifications!

Thank you,

Tyler
